                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently studying fullstack development at UCLA to pursue a career in computer science. I graduated
                    from Southern New Hampshire as a Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor's in International Business Management
                    with a minor in Finance. </p>
                <p>I am passionate about leadership and finding the best solutions possible for problems. I hope to take
                    what I am learning at UCLA to help solve complex problems working with creative teams to help improve
                    the world little by little.</p>
